# The Weimar Project

When many people think of LGBT history, they may look back at the Stonewall riots, or possibly the work of the Mattachine Society in the United States as the beginning of the fight for equality. However, a significant piece of western LGBT history began in Germany. First in the mid to late 1800s, as researchers studied transgender and homosexuality identities through a scientific lens, then later in the period between the world wars as Germany's LGBT community found more freedom to live out of the closet. But one of the great tragedies of the rise of the Nazis and the Holocaust was the nearly complete erasure of this brief gender and sexual revolution.

The purpose of this project is to give a voice to these people, especially Germany's transgender community. This is a memorial to the tens of thousands who were murdered or forced underground by fascist oppressors.
