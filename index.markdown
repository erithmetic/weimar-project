# The Weimar Project

When many people think of LGBT history, they may look back at the Stonewall riots, or possibly the work of the Mattachine Society in the United States as the beginning of the fight for equality. However, a significant piece of western LGBT history began in Germany. First in the mid to late 1800s, as researchers tried to classify transgender and homosexual behavior, then later in the period between the world wars as Germany's LGBT community found freedom to live out of the closet. But one of the great tragedies of the rise of the Nazis and the Holocaust was the nearly complete erasure of this gender and sexual revolution.

The purpose of this project is to give a voice to these people, especially Germany's transgender community. This is a memorial to the tens of thousands who were murdered or forced underground by fascist oppressors.

## A note on the translations

There are several terms that don't have an exact match in English or represent outdated concepts. Following is an explanation of how I decided on how to translate them.

- **Transvestite** - This term was coined by Magnus Hirschfeld in 1918 as an umbrella term for what we would now label "transgender." When this term is used to refer to the community, I translate it to "transgender." If an author self-identifies as "transvestite" in an article, I use the original term.
- **Dual-sex** - In German this appears as "zweigeschlecthlich," lit. "having two (sexes/genders)." Some dictionaries translate this to "bisexual" but in English this refers to sexual orientation, not biological sex or gender. "Bi-gender" was considered, but this term applies to gender identity when the text seems to refer to what is now known as "intersex." The latest scientific thinking at that time was that both non-cis-gender identities _and_ non-heterosexual orientations could together be explained by some biological factor &mdash; that gender and orientation were linked together so that feminine men were attracted to men and masculine women to women. This idea of course had its detractors among masculine cis gay men. I use the term "dual-sex" because it stands apart from our current understanding of intersex biology and gender identity.
