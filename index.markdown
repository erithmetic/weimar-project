# The Weimar Project

For many people, LGBT history begins at the Stonewall Inn in New York, or possibly with the Mattachine Society in the United States. However, a significant piece of western LGBT history began in Germany. First in the mid to late 1800s, as researchers tried to classify transgender and homosexual behavior, then later in the period between the world wars as Germany's LGBT community found freedom to live out of the closet. But one of the great tragedies of the rise of the Nazis and the Holocaust was the nearly complete erasure of this gender and sexual revolution.

The purpose of this project is to give a voice to these people, especially Germany's transgender community. This is a memorial to the tens of thousands who were murdered or forced underground by fascist oppressors. As we hear these voices, may we ever repeat, _Nie Wieder_ -- Never Again.

# Background

In 1918 Germany formed the "Weimar Republic," its first democratically elected government, from the ashes of a racist, conservative empire. In that time, Germany boomed and became the epicenter of transgender, gay, and lesbian culture. Magnus Hirschfled, a gay physician and sexologist, formed the very first institute dedicated to sexology. The institute broke ground in researching gender and sexuality as a normal condition, rather than written off as a mental defect. Doctors connected with this institute performed the first transgender surgeries (one patient was the now-famous Lili Elbe, popularly known as _The Danish Girl_). The institute even housed a group of transgender women, giving them jobs and offical passes so as not to be harassed by police.

However, the interwar years were also very tumultuous. Germany was punished heavily by the international community after World War I. There was fear that the communist revolution in Russia would spread into Germany (in fact, the state of Bavaria briefly declared independence as a communist state). Armed right-wing paramilitary groups formed from disbanded army units roamed the country in an attempt to suppress socialism. Finally, the global financial crash of 1927 brought hyperinflation and more poverty. The Nazis fed on this unrest and managed to capture 37% of the vote by 1932. The old monarchists and business interests backed Hitler in the hope of stopping the feared communists and bringing order back to the country. However, Hitler took advantage of the situation to become perpetual dictator and mass murderer.

Unfortunately, one of the first targets of the Nazis' reign of terror was Hirschfeld's institute. A Nazi student group marched into the institute and hauled all of their books and journals away to be burned in a public square. Anything transgender or homosexual-related was considered "un-German." LGBT people were some of the first groups of people tried and sent to concentration camps. This loss set the LGBT movement back by nearly 40 years until Stonewall. Luckily the torch was carried in the US by Henry Gerber's Society for Human Rights and later the Mattachine Society.
