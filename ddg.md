  <h1>Das 3. Geschlecht</h1>
    <p>
    In the final years of the Weimar Republic, a magazine was published called, "Das 3. Geschlecht," or "The Third Sex" (the term Geschlecht translates to both "sex" and "gender"). This was the first known magazine to be directly marketed towards what we would now call transgender people. It's remarkable that nearly 100 years ago there was already a cultural understanding forming of LGBT rights and acceptance. This magazine is also particularly interesting because it features stories by trans people who were experiencing life openly as their true gender identity.
