# Das 3. Geschlecht

In the final years of the Weimar Republic, a magazine was published called, "Das 3. Geschlecht," or "The Third Sex" (the term Geschlecht translates to both "sex" and "gender"). This was the first known magazine to be directly marketed towards what we would now call transgender people. It's remarkable that nearly 100 years ago there was already a cultural understanding forming of LGBT rights and acceptance. This magazine is also particularly interesting because it features stories by trans people who were experiencing life openly as their true gender identity.

A word of warning, there are some articles I've translated, such as "Is There a Third Sex?" that have outdated understandings of sex, gender, childhood development, and transgender identities. I included them to show how people were investigating the nature of gender identity and proposing theories that did not pathologize gender non-conforming people, but instead treated them with acceptance and curiosity. At that time they were attempting to explain people who did not fall within the traditional birth-assigned gender roles or behavior.
