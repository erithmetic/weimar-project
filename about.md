## About this project

Giving voice to the queer people of interwar Germany. Formerly a COVID-19 project, now a labor of love led by Erica Kastner.

We are seeking funding to finish translation of two periodicals, The Third Sex and The Girlfriend. We are also seeking trans people with German/English translation skills to help translate. Funding will enable us to pay for the translations.
