# Background

In many ways Germany was quite conservative leading up to World War 2. It briefly flirted with the thought of democracy in 1848, but it remained an authoritarian, militaristic empire under the power of the emperors combined with the strong influence of the conservative catholic and lutheran churches. Scientific inquiry and industrial modernization was strong in Germany, however, which led to the first thinkers in the area of sexology. Throughout the 1800s, scientists started to look at sexuality and gender through a scientific lens in addition to the emerging conservative viewpoints that queerness was a disorder.

Just before World War 1, there was a growing conciousness around homosexuality and the old sodomy laws (Paragraph 175 under the German legal code) were starting to be questioned. Queerness was tolerated to a very slight degree, especially in Berlin and industrial German cities. There were some queer bars and cabarets established by World War 1, but any queer activity had to remain hidden from the general public. By this time Germany (especially Berlin) was already gaining a reputation as a place where queer sexuality was largely tolerated.

Due to the defeat in World War 1, in 1918 Germany formed what is now referred to as the "Weimar Republic," its first democratically elected government. This seismic shift was seen as the beginning of a new modern age by many (though resented by those with authoritarian, militaristic views). Censorship laws were loosened and queer publications began to circulate as queer clubs formed around the country. Magnus Hirschfled, a gay physician and sexologist, formed the very first institute dedicated to sexology. The institute broke ground in researching gender and sexuality, and postulated queerness as a natural condition rather than a moral vice. Doctors connected with this institute performed the first transgender surgeries (one patient was the now-famous Lili Elbe, popularly known as _The Danish Girl_). The institute even housed a group of transgender women, giving them jobs and offical passes so as not to be harassed by police.

This era was a relative golden age for queer people. While publications fought with censors and queer spaces had tenuous relationships with the police, the general social attitude was that queer people could never be completely rooted out by the state. The idea was to tolerate a certain amount of "vice" as long as it didn't corrupt the youth and remained out of the public square.

Several currents of thought prevailed at the time that affected how people viewed queerness. One was that the nation should be strong, which means they rely on strong, heteronormative families. In this sense homosexuality was seen as a national weakness. Another was the idea of eugenics, that society as a whole should be improved by access to abortion and controlling breeding in order to weed out congenital disease. In this sense homosexuality could either be seen as a "natural evolutionary dead end (i.e. 'degenerate')" and people be allowed the dignity to live out the rest of their lives that way, or it could be seen as a "sickness" to be rooted out. Another idea was that homosexuality was purely a social contagion that spread when children were exposed to trashy media or seduced by older queers. Or another idea was that homosexuality was not biological, but the result of self-actualization (i.e., personal choice). Specifically, that cis gay men were an elite group embodying the Greek ideal. This line of thinking often flirted with fascist ideology.

The furthest that queer acceptance got politically was when the government began to re-review the criminal code. Hirschfeld's "Scientific Humanitarian Committee" lobbied heavily and reached many people with the idea that sodomy laws were causing more harm than the "good" of containing homosexuality. The frequent blackmail and suicides associated with homosexuality were a constant issue and the law coudln't adequately determmine what actually constituted a "homosexual act." While there was consideration of repealing the sodomy law completely, a compromise was reached which basically said that homosexual acts were legal, unless done with minors under 21 or for prostitution. This compromise created a rift between Hirschfeld's camp who championed an approach of respectability politics and "born this way" explanations for queerness versus the masculinist, self-actualized gay groups. Unfortunately, due to conservative backpedaling and the rise of the Nazis, the sodomy law was never repealed or improved. In fact, the law was made more strict when the Nazis came to power.

Despite the rush to modernism and relative acceptance of queerness, the interwar years were very tumultuous. Germany went through hyperinflation, an invasion by France into the Ruhr valley, various coup attempts by anti-democratic, right-wing groups (including the Nazis), and constant direct action by communists. Armed right-wing paramilitary groups formed from disbanded army units roamed the country in an attempt to suppress communism. Finally, the global financial crash of 1929 brought crippling poverty. The Nazis fed on this unrest and managed to capture 37% of the vote by 1932. The old monarchists and business interests backed Hitler in the hope of stopping the feared communists and bringing order back to the country. However, Hitler took advantage of the situation to become perpetual dictator and mass murderer.

Unfortunately, one of the first targets of the Nazis' reign of terror was Hirschfeld's institute. A Nazi student group marched into the institute and hauled all of their books and journals away to be burned in a public square. Anything transgender or homosexual-related was considered "un-German." LGBT people were some of the first groups of people tried and sent to concentration camps. 

This loss set the LGBT movement back by nearly 40 years until Stonewall. Luckily the torch was carried in the US by Henry Gerber's Society for Human Rights and later the Mattachine Society.
