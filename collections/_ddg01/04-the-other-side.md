_A Transgender Tale_

Issue 1, article 4 (May 1930)

Mrs. Olga looked down through the green hanging plants of the small winter garden down to the wide street. Walking down this street was her husband, Councilor Berndt, accompanied by some colleague.

He walked briskly as he always did, stopped for a moment at his house, and said goodbye to the other person.

She watered the little cacti, which were all planted in white, gold-rimmed pots. They gave Helmut so much joy. She then put the watering can back in the corner and returned to the living room, which was glowing in the first sunny afternoon in March.

Just then her husband opened the door, and when he stepped into the light she saw he was quite tired and weary. She held out her fine, pale hand to him, which he kissed, then she went into dining room and sat at the table.

"Did you have a long day, Helmut?" she asked, looking searchingly into that narrow, beardless face with an energetically protruding nose, which didn't quite fit with his feminine mouth and chin. He shook his blonde head.

"I'm OK, dear, work is less busy, but I'm tired again &mdash; you know &mdash; well, yes &mdash; &mdash;" He broke off and Olga brushed his hand with a soft, almost motherly tenderness.

"A letter from Rolf is sitting on your writing desk &mdash;" she smiled strangely and forlornly, the way one smiles with the joy of a beloved child. Just then a glow flew out of the Councilor's deeply potted, dark blue eyes, and he sprang up.

"You'll allow me? But first I have to know &mdash;" 

For a moment she clasped her hands tightly in her lap and looked at him, that tall, slender man whose wonderful passion that only she, she alone knew and was allowed to know.

Perhaps he sensed in his sensitivity, which he usually knew how to hide quite well, that underneath it all she merely tolerated it. Yet there was no closer friendship, no more heartfelt attraction than what Hellmuth Berndt and Olga had with each other.
