Issue 1, article 2 (May 1930)

"Selma, what's wrong with you?" It happened every day when the child came home from playing with the boys in suburbs, battered and scratched. Or when the teachers complained about her apathy and laziness at school. Her father said it in a stern tone, her mother with tender concern. "If you're not going to shape up, what's going to become of you?" In the square and angular features of her daughter, she searched in vain for any trace of feminine charm that could reassure her of her daughter's future. Streaky, dull black hair, ample, defiant eyebrows over a pair of small, slit eyes, long arms, and big hands. How would any man ever want to marry her?

In the last year of the Great War, a surveyor from the German civil administration moved into a seculded house on the Vistula River. He was taken with the view of the river. As an enemy of the Fatherland, Selma disdained him. Her parents, however, hoped for some relief from his stay in the house and treated him kindly. He enjoyed the garden where the old house stood and Slema's father allowed him to do the gardening.

After a few weeks, Selma approached him, initially offering to help only with small tasks, but eventually became his helper. She was proud of his praises when he came home from work and saw the fingerling potatoes chopped, the weeds pulled, and the paths raked.

"I'm sure you'll be a great gardner girl[^fn1] one day," he said. She shook her head, "gardner girl? No! I'm going to be a bridge builder!"

The German was surprised by such a completely un-ladylike dream. Her parents just laughed.

In school, Selma was still had problems, except in gymnastics.

Fall came, and with it one harsh week ...

[^fn1]: GÃ¤rtnerin. German is a gendered language and this is the feminine form of "gardener."
