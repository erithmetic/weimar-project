_The Adventures of a Trans Woman_

[Das 3. Geschlect](/das-dritte-geschlecht/) Issue 1, article 5 (May 1930)

The day was unforgettable for me, the first time I walked the streets as a woman. Long had I longed for it and only experienced it in secret dreams. I had found a good friend to whom I was able to reveal what had slumbered inside me as a carefully guarded secret since childhood. With loving understanding, she was happy to help me fulfill my most secret wishes.

Not much preparation was necessary, as I was used to wearing elegant women's clothing underneath my men's clothing, and yet, as soon as the opportunity arose, I swapped the forced masculine mask with my real face, that of a woman, and was used to wearing women's clothing and jewelry at home. Also, my figure, with its accentuated hips, the slim waist, the feminine back line, the narrow, sloping shoulders and the feminine bust, was better suited to the clothes than the suit.

I needed little tutoring from a knowledgeable woman to complete the outward image of a lady in going-out clothes. The hat cast soft shadows over the veiled face, which had only a faint touch of powder, a barely noticeable bit of eyeliner and a trace of rouge. Inconspicuous blonde, which mingled with my curly hair on the forehead, flowed in heavy waves over the ears adorned with fine pearls and tied into a full bun at the nape of the neck. The high-necked blouse was decorated with a delicate clasp. The dark tailored dress sat wonderfully, from which the hand, half shrouded in lace, looked narrow and small in the white glove. The umbrella rested in my arm like a good friend. A discreet perfume and the soft clinking of the bracelets rounded off the picture, which was of inconspicuous elegance. I felt all of this as I passed the children playing on the stairs of the elegant house in which the change had just taken place.
