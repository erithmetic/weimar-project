Issue 1 (May 1930)

We've always classified people into just two sexes. But for a number of years the term "third sex" has been appearing again and again. Thousands have used the phrase, joking off-hand, sneering, clueless of how much sorrow and suffering, how much struggle and despair lurks behind this term. Few know that "third sex" is not just a slur for male and female eccentrics, but that it has actually existed for thousands of years, yes, presumably it already existed on Earth before the other two sexes. There are scholars who want to prove that the first people were dual-sex, i.e. man and woman united in one person.

According to the old biblical creation story, Adam was created first, and from his body sprang Eve. Hence forth were they "man and wife," and were literally united into one body. It's quite likely that the old biblical chroniclers wanted to suggest that prehistoric people with dual sexes eventually developed into separate ones. There is no doubt there were people on Earth long before Adam and Eve. Because the bible only speaks about a part of the Earth's population, we've unfortunately lost the history of the rest of the people, and we can therefore only prove the existence of other types of beings from the traces that are still evident in our bodies today. The fact is that both men and women today, after so many thousands of years, clearly carry recognizable signs of the other sex. The most striking of these are the man's nipples, which have the sole purpose of suckling children. But the female body also shows a remnant of the male in its genitals, namely the clitoris, which is nothing more than an undeveloped penis.

We know that the ovum in the womb in its first stage is genderless, and that a few weeks after fertilization, each embryo develops female sex organs first. The developing child then either develops further into a female being, or the female genitals wither, and instead the male organs, which were barely perceptible, develop. Thus, every male person develops not only from a female body, but also from a female embryo. If we were to only draw conclusions from this singular process, we would not say that Eve came out from Adam, but that Adam comes from Eve.

If we now know that male children were female in their first stages of development, then had male and female genitals, until finally the latter withered, then it's understandable that in every person there is a dual-sex nature. And it is no longer surprising that there are living creatures in which one can still clearly demonstrate the presence of a dual-sex nature. Let's assume that in the male child the original female nature did not completely wither and simultaneously developed a male nature. The result of this would be that the child -- depending on the degree of the dual nature -- more or less inclined to another sex, that a boy showed very feminine tendencies and would be girlish and tender in his character, games, and hobbies. But not only in mental attributes, we also find differences in the physique of the opposite sexes.

In typical men we see broad shoulders and narrow hips. In typical women we see a wide pelvis, which indicates the purpose of motherhood, as well as the breasts which expand during sexual maturity. 

However, there are now endless different forms from one sex to another, which any layperson would see as a third sex. But it's actually nothing more than a steady union of both sexes in a single person.

We find women with a masculine type, masculine physiques: strong bones, flat chest, slim pelvis; with a masculine soul, feelings, and thought patterns; women in men's clothes and short cut hair that speak with a sonorous voice. No one would perceive them as women at first glance.

On the other hand there are men with perfectly feminine physiques. Just take a look at the female impersonators in variety shows! Round shoulders, voluptuous breasts, strong hips, small hands and feet. In a deep-necked ball gown with feminine wigs, you can hardly recognize the man when he speaks in a falsetto. But there are many small differences that are only recognizable to the doctor's eye. The genitals can be completely normal.

The dual-sex nature of humans is not always evident in their exterior.
