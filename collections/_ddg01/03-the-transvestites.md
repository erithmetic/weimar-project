[The Third Sex](/das-dritte-geschlecht/) Issue 1, article 3 (May 1930)

Translator's note: _This article goes over the definitions of BDSM, transvestism, and homosexuality. It explains these as natural variations in nature, just like weather systems and animal species. It then dives into intersex variation and the difference between biological sex and gender identity. Some sections are of retrospective interest to modern readers which I will be translating in the future._
