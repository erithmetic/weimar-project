[The Third Sex](/das-dritte-geschlecht/) Issue 2, article 4 (September 1930)

A letter from a trans man[^fn1] who desperately fights for his rights by all means shows that it is not only trans women who have to struggle with difficulties, unfortunately in vain - as the following lines show: 

The facts are as follows: A. was born as a girl, showed transgender tendencies from early childhood, always felt masculine mentally and, after having become of majority age, sought permission to wear masculine clothes and to use a masculine first name. This permission was given to him in Berlin because, according to a prominent report, Adam's body had developed in such a way that the masculine internal substances (testicles) had gained the upper hand in the course of time. Despite the fact that the external structure remained feminine, the risk was taken to apply for re-registration in the civil registry[^fn2].

The preparatory investigations began in early 1927 and were quickly completed, so that shortly afterwards the famous and notorious official path could be started. 

[^fn1]: The original source uses "transvestite woman" and "transvestite man" throughout, but I've translated them to the modern "trans man" and "trans woman," respectively. See [about the term Transvestite](/about-the-term-transvestite).
[^fn2]: Presumably this meant he would be registered for military conscription.
