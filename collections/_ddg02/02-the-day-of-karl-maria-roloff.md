His mother was trembling in a tizzy. He howled like a palace dog. Next to him, on the ground like a trampled white rose, lay his silk dress, which he had saved for himself from miserably earned overtime pay. Flung by his mother's feet into the most distant, darkest corner, the shoes lay, petite, small, patent leather high heeled[^fn1] shoes with buckles &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; the white of the new women's stockings gleamed in contrast to his body, which was only clad in a casual shirt. His eyes flowed with tears &hellip; This was the end of the nightmare that haunted him for years: an end without a beginning! &mdash; And how divine he had imagined everything:

Compelling walzes &mdash; &mdash; handsome men &mdash; &mdash; enchanting women &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;

He was altogether terrified. His mother straightened out the dress and laid it down next to him: "There, bring the plunder back; today, right away! We beggar folk have no money for &mdash; &mdash;!" The rest drowned in an inarticulate gurgle. A flood of tears began to cool her inner infuriation. She ran out.

When he woke up the next morning, he was in bed; just like always. He put his hands on his temples and pondered. Should he have dreamed that? If he hadn't been sitting on the edge of the bed and &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; But then his mother came and knocked on the door. As always! He jumped up, washed, dressed, carefully combed the soft, blond hair that fell in soft strands on his forehead.

Then he stepped out: "Good morning!" &mdash; &mdash; very modestly, almost like a whisper he breathed the greeting. His mother fiddled with the stove. She turned and smiled at him as she did every morning: "good morning, my boy!"

He dared not speak a syllable. His thoughts kept arguing about whether he had dreamed all this, or whether &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; but no, then his mother would, after all &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;
