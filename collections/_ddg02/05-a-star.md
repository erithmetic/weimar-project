[The Third Sex](/das-dritte-geschlecht/) Issue 2, article 5 (September 1930)

- Roll in, your hurried clouds
- Spread them out in eternal distance
- But you cannot chase me
- The one &mdash; single star.

- Because I know me, my soul
- Hurts and fills with darkest Night
- O, grant me the star's light,
- It is my laugh of relief.

- You find on our paths
- Such deep sadness and hurt
- But you will never behold
- Such an anxious, quaking heart.

- &mdash; Roll in, your hurried clouds,
- Spread them out in eternal distance,
- But you cannot chase me
- The one &mdash; single star. &mdash; &mdash;.
