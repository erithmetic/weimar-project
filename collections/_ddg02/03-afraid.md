[The Third Sex](/das-dritte-geschlecht/) Issue 2, article 3 (September 1930)

- The sun is hidden
- The rose is blooming
- Where is the morning
- From which yesterday escapes?
- Where the caressing radiance of the world
- Where the pleasing sounds fall down upon,
- That which radiates from people's eyes,
- That flows against us on our paths?
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There I want to be.
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in my heart
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trading pain for
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace within.
