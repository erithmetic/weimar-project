[The Third Sex](/das-dritte-geschlecht/) Issue 3, article 10 (February 1931)

- We, who go our entire lives alone
- With warm hearts stand aside
- While the others drink with friends
- We survive without!
- We carry the burden of existence
- Never able to take &mdash; only giving
- Always waiting before closed doors
- Never able to live &mdash; yet were born
- Carry on patiently! But why?
- Fate, you owe us the answer!
