[The Third Sex](/das-dritte-geschlecht/) Issue 3, article 3 (February 1931)

- O cruel fate, o dark power,
- You kept me from everything, from everything!
- Never do I cause the sun to flood its light,
- Yet still the sparkling wine entices me,
- Because everything that delights other hearts
- Was hidden from me forever.
- And in the darkening torment of night
- I ask myself a thousand times
- Did nature work with compelling justice
- Creating the third sex as children of misery?
